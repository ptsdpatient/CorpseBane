A broken CCTV camera. Staring into nothing now.
Shattered glass. A violent end.
A broken clock. Time is lost here.
A basketball. Covered in dust, left behind.
An abandoned drink. Long cold.
A scalpel. Still sharp, stained.
A pair of tongs. Heavy and rusted.
A broken display. Flickering, malfunctioning.
A prosthetic limb. Abandoned, like its owner.
Whispers. Stuck in the walls, fading.
A keyboard. Keys worn from desperate typing.
An identity card. Tattered, no name left.
A pair of shoes. Left in a hurry, scuffed.
Blood stains...
Scratch marks. Something tried to escape.
A guinea pig tag. From a lab experiment.
A trash can. Overflowing with discarded waste.
An old LED bulb. Barely holding onto its light.
Papers scattered. Important, but forgotten.
Playing cards. A game abandoned mid-round.
Silver and gold coins. Worthless now.
An amulet. The inscription worn down to nothing.
